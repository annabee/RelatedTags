## Related tags
---
A tag is a label provided by the reader of the given document. A document can have one or more tags.
This app computes how the tags which are related to each other. Tags are related to each other if they occur multiple times together.


### Instructions
In order to run this example, please provide a data source by updating the `tags.csv` file in the resources directory.

The application is configured to compute a maximum of three related tags per tag, please change that in the main method as necessary.

The output will be saved at the root of this directory as a csv file called result with the timestamp of when it was created (this is to stop clashes and overwrites).
